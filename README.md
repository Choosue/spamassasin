# SPAMASSASIN

This is my first spam classifier using machine learning technology.

The file 'spamassasin.m' holds the main structure of my system. Each file was well documented, feel free to watch and copy the codes for your own use.

The algorithm I used was SVM, and the SVM function library was [libsvm](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) developed by [National Taiwan University](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/)
